# The World
## Vibes

You can read more about the world of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] in the supplementary material I give, but here are some general vibes I'm going for.
### 1. A war is brewing

War between the nations of [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]] and [[Nations/Anbuur\|Anbuur]] has not yet begun, but tensions have been rising for some time. Skirmishes at the border, failed peace talks, and growing unrest due to widespread cult activity spark anxieties across [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]]. Even the shoe-shiners earning their bread in [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Kithraia\|Kithraia]]'s bustling [[Azure Square\|Azure Square]] can see the writing on the wall, a sentiment whispered between busker and banker alike, "war is coming".
### 2. Magic low powered, but magic items are sacred

[[Mortal Races/Mortal Races\|Mortal races]] make inefficient conduits of magic, especially so after the death of [[Kethryllia\|Kethryllia]], goddess of magic, at the end of the [[The Ages/Third Age\|Third Age]]. Spellcasters of the [[The Ages/Current Age\|Current Age]] can still perform feats of great magic, but they require long periods of arcane rejuvenation to recover spent spell slots (See the section on long/short rests below). As a result, the people of [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]] rarely rely on or even see magic in their daily lives; and when magic does become a factor (like in the sorcerous bloodlines of the [[Great Houses of Jkaverstelle\|Great Houses of Jkaverstelle]]), one's magical ability is easily overshadowed by relative prestige, power, and money one holds. 

By contrast, magical items are revered across [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]]. Said to be divine in nature, items imbued with magic are powerful, respected, and rare. The methods to create these items were lost at the end of the [[The Ages/Third Age\|Third Age]], but even at the time, the items created by the fallen [[Nations/Linthirian Empire\|Linthirian Empire]] paled in comparison to the legendary artifacts of the ages preceding it. To this day, magical items are considered sacred by the [[Church of the Divine Aspects\|Church of the Divine Aspects]] and are guarded fiercely by their lucky owners. 
### 3. The Cults of [[The World/Dor'Daedeloth\|Dor'Daedeloth]]

[[The World/Dor'Daedeloth\|Dor'Daedeloth]] is the damnable realm parallel to [[The World/Dor'Balar\|Dor'Balar]], and the home of demons, fey, and monstrosities seeking the destruction of all [[Mortal Races/Mortal Races\|mortal races]] and the remaining [[The World/Divine Aspects\|Divine Aspects]]. According to scripture, denizens of [[The World/Dor'Daedeloth\|Dor'Daedeloth]] have sought out mortals since time immemorial, offering untold power for the price of mortal souls and the dominion over these damned bargainers after death. The power of the [[The World/Divine Aspects\|Divine Aspects]] have historically kept these demons at bay, but recently, reports of cult activity and demon sightings have been on the rise. Authorities have yet to identify what's driving these heretical embers, but the [[Church of the Divine Aspects\|Church of the Divine Aspects]] and the ruling powers of [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]] and [[Nations/Anbuur\|Anbuur]] all agree that it needs to be snuffed out.

# Character Creation
## Hook

You'll start in the [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Kithraia\|Kithraia]], the capital city of [[Nations/Jkaverstelle\|Jkaverstelle]] asked by the [[Honored Watch\|Honored Watch]] to investigate some strange happenings in the eastern arboreal town of [[Cities and Towns/Jkaverstelle/Dru-Karmaz\|Dru-Karmaz]]. 
## Basic Info

- Your characters will begin the campaign at **level 3**.
- Starting at a decent level with good stats, your characters can be respected/powerful members of the community (E.g., business owners, professors, nobles, war heroes, officers in the thieves guild, lieutenants in the [[Honored Watch\|Honored Watch]]). Though if you'd prefer playing someone with more humble standing, that's definitely fine too.
## Rolling For Stats

In this campaign, I'm using the "**roll 5d6 and pick the top 3**" method when rolling for stats. E.g., if I rolled 5d6s and got [6, 5, 5, 3, 1], I would add the highest three values (6+5+5) to get 16.

That said, feel free to use standard array, point by, or roll 4d6 pick top 3 if you'd prefer (though those will likely result in lower stats).
## Rolling for HP

When you level up past level 1, you gain maximum hit points equal to the **greater value between**: 
1. Average value for your hit die (rounded up)
2. What you roll on a hit die
... plus your constitution modifier. In a sense, this means you'll either get the normal "average value for your hit die (rounded up)" as a **minimum** with the chance that you increase your HP even more if you roll well enough.

E.g., if I level up and take a level of monk (1d8 hit die), then the average value for that die is 5 hit points. I can then roll my 1d8 and choose the larger between the roll and that average of 5. So if I rolled a 2 on my 1d8 roll, I'd use the 5 plus my constitution modifier, but if I rolled a 7, I could use that 7 plus my constitution modifier.

# Rule Changes
## Long Rests = 7 days, Short Rests = 8 hours

This is a pretty major change, but for this campaign I'm running with the alternate rule-set where a **long rest takes a week** and a **short rest takes 8 hours**. 

>Note: This does ***NOT*** mean that I'm going to have you play through 10 days of encounters before giving you a long rest. That would be cruel and unusual punishment. 

Like it says in the rulebook, the game is balanced for somewhere between 5-8 resource expending encounters between long rests (sometimes combat, sometimes puzzle solving requiring resources). I'll try easing us into this and not have too many encounters at the beginning of the campaign to see how we like it, but this is at least how I want to start. Plus, since I wanted this world to have lower-powered magic than we've done before, requiring a long period of rest for spellcasters to get their slots back seemed to fit.  ~~(Unless of course, you're willing to play a warlock ðŸ˜ˆ)~~

> [!NOTE] Marshalls vs. Casters
> Spellcasters in D&D are generally much more powerful than marshal characters, there's a reason why in the Icewind Dale damage calcs, our top 3 performers were full spell casters (and it wasn't even really close). By using the 5-8 encounters per long rest, I think the Marshal/Caster breakdown will be something closer to:
> 
> Marshalls excel at sustained damage + tank, while spellcasters excel at explosive damage in a pinch + versatility/support with their magic.

## Recharging Items/Abilities

Similar to the above long/short rest rule, if a magic item or ability has wording like "The item regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily **at dawn**," it instead activates that recharge on Sundays at dawn. (I.e., once a week)
## Material Components and Tracking Weights?

This is something we can discuss during session 0, but there are a handful of rules/mechanics we may want to look into for this campaign.

1. **Do we want to require magic users to acquire the material components for their spells, or should we allow them to use magical focuses?** 
   
   On one hand, since magic is generally more mundane in this world, requiring spellcasters to forage or purchase spell components may ground it further. On the other hand, magical components can be a pain to keep track of, and might be more-annoying than it's worth. 
   
   Let's talk about what we want to see, and if some players using spellcasters want to use material components and some don't, we can always say that in this world that only certain classes can use magical focuses, and others need the material components. E.g., if a wizard player wants to require have material components but a cleric player doesn't want to bother, we can say that in this world spellcasters using divine magic can use their holy symbols, but wizards lacking that godly connection must resort to using material components.
   
1. Do we want to track weight in the game and/or prevent physically weak characters are carrying too much? 
   
   On one hand, strength is generally the least important skill in D&D and is frequently dumped during character creation, so by adding either rules for **carrying capacity**, **encumbrance**, or both, it might make that stat feel more impactful. On the other hand, it can be annoying to keep track of items and item weight, so it might be more trouble than it's worth. 
   
   For context, here are the rules for carrying capacity and encumbrance:
   
> [!NOTE] **Carrying Capacity**
> Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters donâ€™t usually have to worry about it.
   
> [!NOTE] **Encumbrance**
> If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you areÂ **encumbered**, which means yourÂ [speed](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Movement?expansion=34047#toc_1)Â drops by 10 feet.
> 
> If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are insteadÂ **heavily encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you haveÂ [disadvantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_2)Â onÂ [ability checks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=34047#toc_4), attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
